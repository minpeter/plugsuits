### shell_interact
**Purpose**: Return guidance for interactive process handling

**When to use**:
- Prompt response guidance (`y<Enter>`, `n<Enter>`, `<Ctrl+C>`)
- Recovering from long-running interactive workflows

**Important constraint**:
- This tool does not control a persistent terminal session
- It returns instructions only; it does not execute commands

**Notes**:
- No terminal session is retained between calls
- Use `shell_execute` for actual command execution
- For interruption, use timeout handling or explicit `shell_execute` kill commands
