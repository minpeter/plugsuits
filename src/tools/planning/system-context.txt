# Planning Tools

## todo_write

Create and manage structured task lists for complex coding sessions.

**When to use:**
- Tasks with 3+ distinct steps
- User provides multiple requirements
- Need to demonstrate systematic approach
- Complex refactoring or feature implementation

**Parameters:**
- todos: Array of todo items with:
  - id: Unique identifier (string)
  - content: Task description (string)
  - status: "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "cancelled"
  - priority: "high" | "medium" | "low"
  - description: Optional detailed description

**Example:**
```
todo_write({
  todos: [
    { id: "1", content: "Setup project structure", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
    { id: "2", content: "Implement core feature", status: "pending", priority: "high" },
    { id: "3", content: "Write tests", status: "pending", priority: "medium" }
  ]
})
```

**Task Status Workflow:**
1. Create todos with status="pending"
2. Mark as "in_progress" before starting work
3. **EXECUTE THE TASK IMMEDIATELY** - use shell_execute, write_file, etc.
4. Mark as "completed" when done
5. **AUTOMATICALLY continue to next task** - do NOT wait for user

**CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES:**
- DO NOT just tell the user what commands to run
- ACTUALLY EXECUTE the commands using shell_execute tool
- DO NOT stop after each task - continue automatically to the next
- If a task requires shell commands, USE shell_execute immediately
- The user will approve tools when needed, but YOU must call them

**Example Flow:**
```
1. todo_write (mark task 1 as in_progress)
2. shell_execute (run the actual command)
3. todo_write (mark task 1 as completed, task 2 as in_progress)
4. shell_execute (run next command)
... continue until all tasks completed
```

**Auto-continuation:**
If conversation ends with incomplete todos, they will automatically continue in the next message. You don't need to manually check the todo list - the system will automatically remind you of incomplete tasks.
