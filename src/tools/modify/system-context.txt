## Modify Tools

Use these tools to make changes to files. ALWAYS read files before modifying them.

### edit_file
**Purpose**: Replace specific text in a file (surgical edits)

**When to use**:
- Modifying existing files (changing functions, fixing bugs)
- Replacing specific patterns across a file
- Making targeted changes without rewriting entire file

**Key features**:
- `replace_all: true` replaces all occurrences (useful for renaming)
- `replace_all: false` (default) replaces first occurrence only
- Creates file if it doesn't exist (when `old_str` is empty)

**DO NOT use shell commands**: Use this instead of `sed`, `awk`, or `perl -i`

**Example**: 
```
edit_file("config.ts", "port: 3000", "port: 8080")
edit_file("app.ts", "oldName", "newName", replace_all=true)
```

### write_file
**Purpose**: Create new file or completely overwrite existing file

**When to use**:
- Creating new files from scratch
- Completely replacing file contents (when most of the file changes)
- Writing generated code or configuration

**DO NOT use shell commands**: Use this instead of `echo >`, `cat <<EOF`, or `printf >`

**Example**: `write_file("output.json", '{"status": "ok"}')`

### delete_file
**Purpose**: Permanently delete a file

**When to use**:
- Removing obsolete files
- Cleaning up temporary files
- Deleting files as part of refactoring

**DO NOT use shell commands**: Use this instead of `rm`

**Example**: `delete_file("old-config.js")`
