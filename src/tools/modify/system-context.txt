## Modify Tools

### edit_file
- Replaces `old_str` with `new_str` in a file
- Use `replace_all: true` to replace all occurrences
- Creates the file if it doesn't exist (when `old_str` is empty)
- Preferred over `sed` - no shell escaping issues

### write_file
- Creates or overwrites a file with new content
- Preferred over `echo >` or `cat <<EOF`

### delete_file
- Deletes a file permanently
