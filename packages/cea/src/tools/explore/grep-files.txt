### grep_files
**Purpose**: Search file contents by regex or literal pattern

**When to use**:
- Finding function/variable usages
- Locating specific code patterns and messages

**Output format**:
- Match lines are emitted as `path:{line_number}#{hash_id}|content`
- The `{line_number}#{hash_id}` anchor is directly compatible with `edit_file` hashline refs

**DO NOT use shell**: Prefer this over `grep`, `rg`, `ag`
